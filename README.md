## During the Internship, I worked on the following Projects: 

- **Breast Cancer Prediction -** Predicted **Breast Cancer** using **Logistic**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** regression ML models with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and others

- **Email Spam Detection -** Developed an **Email Spam Detection System** that can **Identify** emails as **Spam** or **Non-Spam** based on their **Content** using **Logistic** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and others

- **Speech Emotion Recognition -** Developed a **Speech Emotion Recognition System** to classify the **Emotion States** conveyed in **Spoken Language** using **Stacked LSTM** regression ML model with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, **Keras**, **Librosa**, and others

- **Terrorism Analysis -** Identified **High-Risk Regions of Terrorism**, extracted meaningful **Insights** and **Patterns**, and understood **Attack Characteristics of Terrorist Activities** with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and others
